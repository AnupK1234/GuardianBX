# GuardianBX 🚨 - Category: Programmers with Experience

## Inspiration 💡

The Bronx is a vibrant community, but like many urban areas, it faces challenges in ensuring the safety and empowerment of all its residents—especially women. Inspired by the spirit of unity and resilience in the Bronx, GuardianBX aims to create a trusted, real-time platform where safety isn't a privilege—it's a right. We believe that by combining technology with compassion, we can build a safer, more alert, and more informed community.

## Problem Statement 📑
The Bronx recorded **over 35,000 reported crimes in 2023** ([Crime Data Source](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ny/bronx/crime)), many involving thefts, harassment, and assaults, especially targeting women and vulnerable groups. However, real-time alerts, transparent reporting, and quick access to emergency contacts remain largely inaccessible to the average citizen. This leads to underreporting, delayed response, and a breakdown in community trust. 

**GuardianBX** addresses these issues by providing a **smart dashboard**, **emergency SOS notifications**, **live incident maps**, and a **compassionate AI assistant** to guide users. Our goal is to empower women and the broader community to take action, report incidents, and stay safe.
